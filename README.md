# TimeSpender
My programm will help you to count the time you're spending on something

This program is recording and counting time you're spend. First of all you
need to have MySql. I was using xampp. Xampp has embedded MySql, you just need to Start it. Then just write settings in programm ( server, port, username, password ) - its for connect to your MySql. 
   Then you can choose theme, for example: I want to read Head First C#: Andrew Stellman book. So, i writing new theme - "C#" in textbox and then i have to pick "Start"; Or if I have already created theme in prev. time, so my Combobox will have this info, So i just choose this theme in ComboBox and clicking "Start". When you clicked Start, time is recording. It will stop when you will Close your application or you click "Stop". In 2 keys your time will be saved to your database.
   
   / RESULTS
   When your Database has views, you can see results. It will show you how many hours you was working with something, for example with books, any technology, maybe Spanish or English, etc.
   
   
Now its beta, i will upgrade my programm.
